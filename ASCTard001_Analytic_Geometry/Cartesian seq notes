Analytic Geometry (ardcore sequencer) notes:


what works:

plays back from grid according to sequencer position on clock input

returns right values and outputs at dac


order to do things:

gates and trigger outs - both triggers DONE

cv record - DONE

when a2 and a3 are at 0 play through the sequence straight otherwise use co-ordinates


morphing idea

Ideas:


investigate difference that a2 and a3 knobs have on vals coming in

if there is no cv input it should do something itself maybe even have the option to use cv inputs to morph preset patterns 

record cv steps in - cv records on clock pulse in to 64 values in matrix

logic to how this could work. if knob 1 and 2 are at 0 then record

anything more than 2 do pattern morph stuff 

attach patterns as external file for ease of use

digital outs should do gate on start of gate and trigger on end
