ASCTard012 - BetaMax

Better Max (and PD) integration. 
I wanted a way to use the ardcore with Max more easily and i came up with this
This sketch consists of both an ardcore sketch and an extern for Max or PD

Install Instructions:


1) Move the Max/Msp or PD external into your search path. You will need to choose the correct extern dependant on your software, platform and 32/64 bit OS. I've provided exeternals for as many options as possible, so hopefully it'll work for you
		If you dont know how to do this try reading this thread http://cycling74.com/forums/topic/stupid-question-where-to-install-external-objects-for-max5/

2) Upload the sketch to your ardcore

3) open the example max/pd patch (ard2max.maxpat/ard2PD.pd)

Once the extern is visible to your software you should be able to open the example patch and it will all become clear.
